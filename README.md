# This was created for encape.me

The idea is a web page which can be used both as a resume and as a reference point for other my projects.

## Features
- Header with name, surname, and job title ( yes, Oxford comma :D )
- Under one section:
    - Side bar with Contacts, Education, Skills
    - Main with Summary / Work Experience 
- My projects, I.E. link to github and/or link to preview.
